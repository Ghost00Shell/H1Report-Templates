# # Limited XSS in mod_proxy error page (CVE-2019-10092)

## Summary

In Apache HTTP Server 2.4.0-2.4.39, a limited cross-site scripting issue was reported affecting the mod_proxy error page. An attacker could cause the link on the error page to be malformed and instead point to a page of their choice. This would only be exploitable where a server was set up with proxying enabled but was misconfigured in such a way that the Proxy Error page was displayed.

## Steps To Reproduce

Go to https://$DOMAIN/%5cgoogle.com/evil.html
Click on error page. 


## Impact
The resulting link can mislead an user to browse into a malicious site.
