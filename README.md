# Bug Bounty Reports Templates

List of templates I have used since I started doing BBH. 

Not all templates would work to every case, even with the same site. For example, some programs in HackerOne have a diffent order and some have more fields. (Yes, I'm talking about you DOD). 


If you have some templates not found here, please create a PR. 

I manage my templates on http://stackedit.io, but now I'm moving to Github to automate the entire process.
